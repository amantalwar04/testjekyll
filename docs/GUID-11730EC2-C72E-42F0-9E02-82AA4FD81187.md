# System Verilog Multiple-File Compilation Unit

Libero SoC v2021.1.supports the multiple-file compilation unit \(MFCU\) for System Verilog, so that constructs defined in one compilation unit are visible in a different compilation unit.

To account for this, the following changes have been made to project settings, Tcl commands, and Simulation & Synthesis in the Libero SoC. For more details, see the following documents:

-   *Libero SoC v2021.1 Design Flow User Guide for RTG4, SmartFusion2, and IGLOO2*
