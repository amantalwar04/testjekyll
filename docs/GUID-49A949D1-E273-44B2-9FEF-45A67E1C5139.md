# SmartDebug MSS Read/Write Access

Libero SoC v2021.1 has an option to access MSS register space in the main window and allow users to write to and read from MSS registers on the fly while operating from the SmartDebug GUI.

This feature is enabled for all PolarFire SOC designs, regardless of the MSS configured in the Libero design.

For more information, see the *SmartDebug User Guide*.
