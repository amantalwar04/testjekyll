# New RTL Level Clock Domain Crossing Analysis and P&R

Libero SoC v2021.1.introduces a new option for analyzing clock domain crossings \(CDC\) in the RTL design, detecting safe synchronizer circuits according to your specification and implementing them in P&R. A new report is generated by the SynplifyPro 2020.09M-SP1 tool bundled with Libero SoC v2021.1 listing all CDC situations in the design. A summary of the placement of the safe synchronizer registers appears in the P&R log.
