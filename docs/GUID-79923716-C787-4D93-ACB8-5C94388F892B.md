# Known Issues and Limitations

The following table lists known issues and limitations associated with Libero SoC v2021.1.

|Family|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Libero**|
|All families|For designs that use the CoreAHBLite combined region slot, the View Memory Map dialog does not show the Range of the combined region slot properly. The expected range of the combined region slot is *n* times the size of each slot, where *n* is the number of slots assigned to the combined region slot. In the View Memory Map dialog, however, the range for the combined region slot is shown as 0x0000\_0000, resulting in a DRC.|
|IGLOO2|For a System Builder design that uses only FDDR out of the DDR/SERDES peripherals, the exported Tcl description file shows the FABRIC\_DDR\_SETTLING\_TIME is not set \(the EXTMEM page is not configured\).

**Note:** This issue does not occur if only MDDR is used or if FDDR is used with MDDR in a design.

 Workaround: If there is a requirement to use a FABRIC\_DDR\_SETTLING\_TIME with a value other than its default value of 200, add the following lines after the Device Features page configuration in the exported Tcl description file.

 `# Configuring the Memories page of System Builder component`

 sb\_configure\_page -component\_name $\{sysbld\_name\} -page\_name \{EXTMEM\} \\ -params \{FABRIC\_DDR\_SETTLING\_TIME:<non\_default\_value\>\}

|
|PolarFire|Opening two or more views in Netlist Viewer \(for example, Hierarchical RTL View and Flattened Post-Compile View\) may cause a crash due to memory usage. Avoid opening multiple views for large designs.

 The DRC check in the I/O Editor does not validate all the constraints set in the tool. You must run Place and Route to validate these constraints.

|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|In Libero, selecting **Disable SNVM** through Debug Policy of Configure Security does not disable sNVM SmartDebug access as expected. This affects the PolarFire family in Libero versions 12.0 and later and PolarFire SoC in Libero versions 12.5 and later.

|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|TCL: The conflicting gated clock setting entered via synthesis configuration options is incorrectly taking priority over Libero Synthesis option. For example: Synthesis configuration options \(-params \{SYNPLIFY\_OPTIONS:secretion -low\_power\_gated\_clock 1\}\) vs Libero Synthesis options \( `-params {CLOCK_GATE_ENABLE:false`\}\).

 Currently, Libero allows these conflicting settings and honors the Synthesis configuration options, which should not occur.

|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|Selecting the option to disable sNVM SmartDebug access control in Debug Policy of Configure Security does not disable access.Workaround: none

|
|RTG4|DRC does not run in the TCL flow when generating RTG4FCCCECALIB, but works properly in GUI mode.|
|N/A|HDL\_LANGUAGE: GLOBAL\_INCLUDE\_PATH: Incorrect behavior when there is a broken link for an include file that contains a module definition.|
|**Synthesis/Simulation**|
|PolarFire|The PLL may generate inaccurate frequency for certain combinations, which can cause PLL outputs to drift over a period.|
|**Timing/Power**|
|PolarFire|The max frequency constraints on the regional clocks in PA5M300XT do not match the datasheet.|
|PolarFire|The violation report shows violations \(red cross\), but the timing report does not \(green check\).|
|PolarFire|Since Libero v12.4, SmartTime stops propagating clocks when a generated clock is reached. For example, in a design whose clocks are clk1 --\> gen1 --\> gen2, specifying gen2 using gen1 as master caused no issues. If gen2 is specified using clk1 as master, however, the generation fails because clk1 is stopped by gen1 and never reaches gen2.

 Workaround: Specify the second generated clock using the first generated clock as master.

|
|PolarFire|The datasheet specifies slight variations of Max Frequency that the software does not represent. In particular, the following two modes have a slightly lower Max Frequency than those specified in the datasheet:-   - 18 × 19 multiplier pre-adder ROM mode
-   - Complex 18 × 19 multiplication

The variations are small and on the high end of the chip frequencies \(between 455 MHz and 470 MHz at dash-one\).

|
|PolarFire|In the SmartTime tool, the search option using **Apply filter** does not work.|
|**SmartDebug**|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|When a dual-mode PCIe design is considered in SmartDebug, the following issues are observed in the PCIe debug feature:

 -   For dual-PCIe designs with PCI0 and PCIe1 controllers, only PCIe1 appears in the UI. PCIe0 is not shown.
-   When PCIe0 Lane is selected, the LTSSM state is shown for PCIe1. The LTSSM state for PCIe0 is not shown.
-   Data Rate, Link Width, and other settings are shown for PCIe1 only, but not for PCIe0.

|
|**Programming**|
|PolarFire|Libero v2021.1 supports the following Micron SPI Flash memory devices:

 -   Using FlashPro5: MT25QL01G only
-   Using FlashPro6: all members of N25Q and MT25Q device families


 For information about support for Flash memory devices from other vendors and device families using FlashPro6, contact Microchip Technical Support.

|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|Although sNVM and eNVM are sanitized when enabled, since the action is part of the bitstream, FlashPro 6 does not report a `Sanitizing sNVM...` or `Sanitizing eNVM...` message during erase operations in a PPD flow.|
|PolarFire, PolarFire SoC|To add SPI-Flash partial programming support to FlashPro 6 and eFlashPro 6 \(iCicile board\), the bitstream format changed to one that is not yet supported by FlashPro 3, 4, and 5 programmers. As a result, programmers cannot program SPI-Flash memory devices with Libero v2021.1.Workaround: Programming jobs created with older versions of Libero still work with Libero v2021.1.

|
|PolarFire SoC|For PolarFire SoC Libero designs that contain eNVM, running VERIFY\_DIGEST after programming device fails and displays the message `eNVM digest verification: FAIL`.

 Workaround: Deselect the procedure **DO\_ENABLE\_ENVM** in the VERIFY\_DIGEST action.

|
|PolarFire SoC|For PolarFire SoC Libero designs that generate or export eNVM-only bitstreams, the generated bitstream file/job includes an ERASE action that is not applicable and does nothing.

 This issue affects Libero versions 12.4 and later. For Libero v12.6, this issue applies for eNVM only case + no eNVM sanitization option.

|
|PolarFire SoC|For Libero designs with sNVM clients configured with no custom user security options selected and whose design will be programmed on the device, modifying sNVM client content and sNVM client Fabric/MSS read/write permissions, running a VERIFY action fails and displays the message `Failed to verify Security` instead of `Failed to verify SNVM`.

 This issue affects Libero versions 12.4 and later.

|
|SmartFusion2, IGLOO2|In FlashPro 5, the Device Info log shows the wrong checksum and design name during SPI Slave programming.|
|**Installation and System Limitations**|
|FlashPro6|Users with FlashPro6 drivers previously installed on their system may see the following message at the end of the installation:

 `The installation of Program Debug Tool v12.5 is finished, but some errors occurred during the install. Please see the installation log for details.`

 Resolution: Uninstall existing FlashPro6 drivers and restart the system before installing Libero SoC v12.5. If the software is already installed, ignore the above message if installation logs do not report errors.

|
|All families|If the installer does not boot in graphical mode, additional X window system libraries might be required.

 For RHEL/CentOS, the following system package is recommended:

 `$ sudo yum install -y libXau libX11 libXi libxcb libXext libXtst libXrender`

|
|All families|Many antivirus and Host-based Intrusion Prevention System \(HIPS\) tools flag executables and prevent them from running. To avoid this block, modify your security setting by adding exceptions for specific executables in the antivirus tool. For assistance, contact the tool provider.

 Many users run Libero SoC PolarFire successfully with no modification to their antivirus software. Microchip is aware of issues for some antivirus tool settings that occur when using Symantec, McAfee, Avira, Sophos, and Avast tools. The combination of operating system, antivirus tool version, and security settings all contribute to the end result. Depending on the environment, Libero SoC, ModelSim ME and/or Synplify Pro ME operation may or may not be affected.

 To ensure that all public releases of Libero software are not infected, each software package is tested with several antivirus applications before being released. To ensure further security, the Microchip software development and testing environment is protected by antivirus tools and other security measures.

|
|All families|The following two errors in the log might appear when the Libero floating license starts:

-   `06/07/2018 21:25:42 (snpslmd) Error: Incompatible vendor daemon found.The vendor daemon <actlmgrd> is not supported in <SCL_2017.12> version. Error: Please upgrade to the latest SCL version. Go to http://www.synopsys.com/licensing for more information.`
-   `06/07/2018 21:25:42 (snpslmd) Error: Incompatible vendor daemon found. The vendor daemon <mgcld> is not supported in <SCL_2017.12> version. Error: Please upgrade to the latest SCL version. Go to http://www.synopsys.com/licensing for more information.`

 These error messages can be ignored safely. The Libero floating license will start properly despite these two error messages.
