# I/O Recalibration

Libero SoC v12.6 introduced the ability to recalibrate I/Os on-demand for each bank.

Libero SoC v2021.1 allows an individual I/O to opt out of recalibration. I/O recalibration is sometimes required to account for delays or to compensate Vt performance impact.

For more information, see the *PolarFire FPGA User I/O User Guide*.
