# Simulation of MSS Streaming interface in User Cryptoprocessor for “S” Devices

Libero SoC v2021.1 introduces simulation support for the MSS Streaming interface in User Cryptoprocessor for PolarFire SoC “S” devices.

The streaming interface is used when Crypto operates in MSS, Shared-MSS, and Shared-Fab modes. The crypto block can be owned by either the fabric or MSS and ownership transferred during operation. To support the ownership the following fabric signals are used. These signals are asynchronous to the fabric design. The appropriate synchronization used in the fabric design within the MSS the FSM controlling this interface runs off the SCB clock and all inputs are synchronized.

For more information, see the *PolarFire SoC MSS Simulation User Guide*.

|Signal|Direction|Description|
|------|---------|-----------|
|Crypto\_fab\_request|Fabric to host|Fabric request or is using the crypto block.|
|Crypto\_mss\_request|Host to fabric|MSS request or is using the crypto block.|
|Crypto\_fab\_release|Fabric to host|Fabric released the core.|
|Crypto\_mss\_release|Internal|MSS released the core.|
|Crypto\_fab\_owner|Host to fabric|Indicates that the Fabric owns the core and the fabric interface is enabled.|
|Crypto\_mss\_owner|Host to fabric|Indicates that the MSS owns the core and the fabric interface is disabled.|
