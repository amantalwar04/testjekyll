# SmartDebug I/O Tap Delays

Libero SoC v2021.1 permits debugging of source synchronous timing margins for dynamically tuned PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX IP interfaces.

To account for this new feature, the SmartDebug main page for PolarFire designed shows a **Debug IOD** button when there is a PF\_IOD\_GENERIC\_RX IP instance configured as Dynamic or Fractional Dynamic mode in the design. The button is not shown for designs where the IP in the modes mentioned is not used.
