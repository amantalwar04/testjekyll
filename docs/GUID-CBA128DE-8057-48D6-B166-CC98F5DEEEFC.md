# Customer Technical Support

Microchip FPGA Products Group staffs its Customer Technical Support Center with highly skilled engineers who can help answer your hardware, software, and design questions about Microchip FPGA Products. The Customer Technical Support Center spends a great deal of time creating application notes, answers to common design cycle questions, documentation of known issues, and various FAQs. So, before you contact us, please visit our online resources. It is very likely we have already answered your questions.

You can communicate your technical questions through our Web portal and receive answers back by email, fax, or phone. Also, if you have design problems, you can upload your design files to receive assistance. We constantly monitor the cases created from the web portal throughout the day. When sending your request to us, please be sure to include your full name, company name, and your contact information for efficient processing of your request.
